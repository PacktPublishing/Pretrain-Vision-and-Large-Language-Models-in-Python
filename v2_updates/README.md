# Updates to book
As it goes in our field, there are constantly new techniques, methods, and technologies that emerge which are helpful to the pretraining process. I'll track these here!

#### How to request an addition
If you'd want to see another paper, trend, model, or technique referenced in this title, feel free to [log an issue](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Pretrain-Vision-and-Large-Language-Models-in-Python/issues) in this repository and I'll add it to this list.

## Papers to add
- Inverse scaling laws for [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07017.pdf). Just wait, I am positive these will be explored in language.
