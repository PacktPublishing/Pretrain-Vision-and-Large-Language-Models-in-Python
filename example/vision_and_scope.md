# Movie Chat

Every good project starts with a great vision for what the end product can be. For example, let's pick something wildly ambitious that we are somewhat reasonably confident is possible. ***Movie Chat!***

How does it work - Movie Chat is an interactive LLM-based agent you can interact with as a writer to easily and quickly craft your own stories.

Movie Chat specializes in long-form film narrative. 

You’ll start by chatting with the agent about types of movies you like, what you are interested in, and what type of message you’d like to share with the world.

Then you can work with Movie Chat to figure out what the basic plot of your narrative is. 

For most films that includes who are your main characters, what happens to them, what struggles they encounter, how they overcome those struggles, and how they change as a result.

MovieChat is great at understanding the basics of narrative construction, so you don’t have to be a total pro. 

MovieChat is also really good at helping visually describe scenes, including camera angles and shots, to help make the movie come to life. 

You’ll have multiple chats available, letting you move between them as you work on different parts of the overall narrative. 

Once you have a clear written form, MovieChat can interact in the visual domain with you to generate visuals for your characters, scenes, and the overall storyboard. 

# Datasets
Now that we have a killer idea, let's flesh out a few example datasets we could use to take some steps towards actually building this. You are probably already thinking about the famous ***IMDB*** dataset, with a sample available on Hugging Face [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb). While is is a great set of reviews, I don't actually think those would help us with producing a net new story from stratch, let alone the storyboard. It might be useful eventually as a signal for the quality of the movies we write, so we'll keep it on the back burner.
