# Pretrain Vision and Large Language Models in Python
Hi there! If you'd like some examples to get hands-on with pretraining your own foundation models, ðŸ§  then you've come to the right place. This repository is meant to pair with my 2023 book on this topic, providing an end-to-end guide for foundation model on AWS. The book has detailed explanation and relevant examples of key topics in the lifecycle of foundation models, including where they come from, why you'd design your own, how to do that, and how to build it into an application.

This repository contains examples to help you implement that guidance at scale. ðŸš€

By July 1, 2023 I'll have some net new examples here for you to follow step-by-step across the whole lifecycle. To get you moving between now and then, you'll find in this repository links to hands-on examples elsewhere that explain how to implememnt everything you learned about in the book.

As mentioned earlier, everything in the book and this repository focuses on AWS and especially Amazon SageMaker. So let's get rolling! ðŸŽ¸
